/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
	This file adds optional material to "MPMB's Character Record Sheet" found at https://flapkan.com/mpmb/charsheets
	Import this file using the "Add Extra Materials" bookmark.

	-KEEP IN MIND-
	It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information (i.e. before making your character with it).
*/

/*  -INFORMATION-
	Subject:    Class
	Effect:     This script adds the class called "Shadowcaster" with its 4 subclasses ("Nightblade", "Shadowmaster", "Shadowsmith", and "Skiamancer"), and its unique spellcasting system

				This class has been made by /u/lysian09 on the subbreddit /r/DnDHomebrew

				It can be found here: https://redd.it/8jxi09/

				This code is based on the second post by /u/lysian09 (2018-05-16)
				This has been labelled v0.2 even though /u/lysian09 doesn't use version numbering

	Code by:	MorePurpleMoreBetter
	Date:		2018-07-23 (sheet v12.999)
*/

/*	-WARNING-
	Only include this script if you intend to use the Shadowcaster class!

	This script changes the headers for spell levels regardless if the character has levels in Shadowcaster or if it or its source is set as included or excluded.

	Because this class has such a different spellcasting system, which doesn't really fit with MPMB's Character Record Sheet, a compromise was found:
		Fundamentals are treated as cantrips.
		Apprentice Mysteries are treated as 1st-level spells.
		Initiate Mysteries are treated as 2nd-level spells.
		Master Mysteries are treated as 3rd-level spells.
		You will have to select the option "All spells known regardless of level" in the spell sheet generation dialog for the Shadowcaster for it to work.

	As no multiclassing rules are given in the source, the ones here are an interpretation by MPMB.

You must be within 100 feet of the illusion to do so.\n   The illusion can speak and mimic the sounds of creatures, and has limited Intelligence. It can't devise a lie on it's own, but it can be instructed to tell a specific lie, and is capable of elaborating without further commands. To do so, it makes an ability check using your Charisma (Deception) modifier.\n   Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your shadow magic save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.",
