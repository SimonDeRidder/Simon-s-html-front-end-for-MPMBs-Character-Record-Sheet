						"To create a shape, you must be conscious and be able gesture both
						forcefully and intricately, requiring at least one free hand."

	`duration`		Always has a (D) added, because all shapes can be dismissed as an 
					action.

	`dependencies`	Is auto-filled with the current elemental affinity if any SpellsList
					object match.

	`range`			Is auto-filled if `rangeInfluence` is set to true.
	`rangeInfluence`Custom attribute to signal this shape needs its range to be calculated
					as determined by level and Con mod.

	`elementalShape`Custom attribute to signal this is a (non-sub) Elemental Shape.

	>> Full descriptions for elemental shapes that have dependencies work different:

	`descriptionFull` For parent shapes with dependencies and sub-shapes,
					  this attribute is auto-generated from `elementalDesc`, see below.

	`elementalDesc` Custom attribute to hold part of the `descriptionFull`.
					For parent: the description except the part for each element.
					For sub-shape: only the part of the element (no bullet point).

	The object name of a sub-shape (i.e. one that should be added to the dependencies),
	has to be the same as the master shape, but with the elemental affinity as a suffix
	using a hyphen.
