/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
	This file adds optional material to "MPMB's Character Record Sheet" found at https://flapkan.com/mpmb/charsheets
	Import this file using the "Add Extra Materials" bookmark.

	-KEEP IN MIND-
	It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information (i.e. before making your character with it).
*/

/*  -INFORMATION-
	Subject:    Class
	Effect:     This script adds the class called "Artificer" by "XP or Level 3"
				This class does not have any subclasses, but instead has a system of 'inventions'

				The Improved Artificer was made by XP or Level 3 and can be found on their Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/posts/improved-class-20621279)

	Code by:	MorePurpleMoreBetter
	Date:		2019-01-30 (sheet v13.0.0beta11)

	Please support the creators of this content (XP or Level 3) on their Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/xptolevel3)

	Caution:	MorePurpleMoreBetter advises against using this class as it breaks game balance (many of its inventions are clearly overpowered). This code was made on commission for a patron.
*/

/*  -IMPORTANT-
	The class' name is "artificer" and will therefor conflict with the Artificer from Unearthed Arcana.
	If you include both this script and the UA:A source, you will notice that the class here is used as its source is more recent.
	It is recommended to have either this source or the UA:A source included, but never both, as they might interfere with each other.

	Some upgrades for Clockwork Constructs can be taken multiple times according to their rules.
	However, the sheet doesn't have a way to accommodate this, so you can only take it once.
	To take a Clockwork Construct upgrade multiple times, apply its changes manually.

	As no multiclassing rules are given in the source, the ones here are an interpretation by MPMB.
