/*	-INFORMATION-
	Subject:	Class
	Effect:		This script adds a class, called "Witch" and its 3 subclasses
				This class has been made and published by William Russell in 2016
				Although it had been published on DMs Guild, it has been
				taken offline sometime in 2018 and is thus no longer available, see:
				https://web.archive.org/web/20180718193751/https://www.dmsguild.com/product/183491/Witch-Class-5e

	Code by:	MorePurpleMoreBetter
	Date:		2023-04-24 (sheet v13.1.6)

	Caution:	MorePurpleMoreBetter advises against using this class as it isn't well constructed (most of its features don't adhere to 5e standards and many rules are interpertations by MPMB as the author references game mechanics from older editions of D&D). This code was made on commission for a patron.
